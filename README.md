## Motivation

I wanted to create this project to further hone the concepts learned in React.js while also learning about the React Context API and Zustand. I did not take part in the creation of the CSS file on this project and was exclusively focused on the React.js fundamentals along with other new technologies mentioned above.

## Description

The website is a simple review/feedback website where users can drop feedback on various companies they want to speak to. Users can write their feedback with the #company-name so that the review can be directed to the right company. The review is also stored in an API and all reviews are fetched from the same API. I did not make the API nor the CSS portion of the project, but I focused exclusively on the React.JS / Zustand portion of the project. Additionally, users can expand the reviews if not all of the text fits nicely into their review section and can upvote on reviews. Updates to the upvotes are not recorded to the API.
